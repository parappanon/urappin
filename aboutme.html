        <div><p>hi there! as you could guess by the very nature of this webpage, i'm the host of this website.<br>
            you can call me the parappanon.<br>
            i live in peru, drink a lot of yogurt, wish i was born earlier and consider parappa the rapper and rozen maiden to be
            unironically the only media franchises i actually like nowadays.<br></p></div>
        <div><p>among my many interests include reading, programming, listening to music, trying to get shit to work on linux
            and diving through parappa-related stuff. i guess its a way to cope with how bad the web is nowadays, what with the three
            letter organizations, the politics and whatnot.</p></div>
        <div><p>overall, though, i guess its nice to meet you. i hope your day goes well, too. get off porn and life-consuming social media,
            enjoy yourself and the world around you.</p>
